Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) 
that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. 
It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, 
which can prevent the accidental modification of data. 
This is often achieved using access modifiers (e.g., private, protected, public).
