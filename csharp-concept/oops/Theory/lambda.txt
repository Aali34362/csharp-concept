Lambda:
A lambda in programming, specifically in C#, refers to an anonymous function that can contain expressions and statements.
It is often used as a concise way to represent small functions that are passed as 
arguments to higher-order methods, such as those used in LINQ queries, event handling, and delegates.

Key Characteristics of Lambda Expressions:
Anonymous Function:
A lambda expression is a function without a name. 
Unlike regular methods, it does not need to be declared separately with a name; it is defined inline.
